# Onboarding — how a desk comes to exist

The reference for the onboarding subsystem: the record model, the build
pipeline, the public API, verification, and provisioning. Everything below
is verified against a running server, driven in Chromium, unless it says
otherwise.

## The shape of it

One record per **application**, not per desk — because all of this happens
before a desk exists. Table `onboarding`, keyed on `enquiry_id`.

Two surfaces work the same record:

| Who | Where | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| The applicant | `/onboarding/CD-XXXXXX` | the code itself |
| Platform team | `/admin#/onboarding/CD-XXXXXX` | platform admin session |

So a desk set up at the counter on Tuesday is finished by its owner on
Wednesday, and neither has to ask the other where they got to.

**Both surfaces now read and write one field list — the design's.**
`server/src/onboarding/flow.ts` used to be a nine-step spec invented before
the design arrived, and the two were quietly disagreeing about what a desk
even has. It is now the design's own screens and the design's own field
names (`operatingName`, `bizName`, `ownerEmail`, `idOver`, `compName`…),
stored flat in `onboarding.answers`. There is no translation layer, because
a translation layer goes stale every time a screen changes.

## The chain

```
apply on the site  →  operator presses "invited" in the panel
                   →  email carries the code AND a link containing it
                   →  /onboarding/CD-XXXXXX  (code already filled in)
                   →  17 screens, saving as they go
                   →  a 6-digit code to their email, checked server-side
                   →  the desk is created and they are signed in
```

All of it verified in a browser: a real application walked screens 0→16,
`POST /launch` returned 201, `tnt-meridianfx` exists with its owner as
administrator, and the application closed itself to `accepted`.

## The build

`CurrencyDesk Onboarding.html` (repo root, the design's standalone dc
bundle) → `scripts/build-onboarding.mjs` → `web/onboarding.html`.

Wired into `npm run build`, into the Render `buildCommand`, and CI fails if
the committed page is stale (`git diff --exit-code web/onboarding.html`).

The build parses the design out of the bundle's `__bundler/template` JSON,
patches the **real source**, and re-serializes — reproducing the bundler's
`</` → `</` escaping, without which the page truncates at the design's
own closing script tag. That means every anchor is readable rather than
written in escaped form.

**18 anchors, every one asserted with an expected occurrence count.** A
re-export that moves one fails the build loudly. The count matters as much
as the match: two call sites where we thought there was one means half the
page kept the old behaviour — which is exactly how the "start over" button
was found still loading the demo desk.

What it changes, and nothing else:

1. **Save / hydrate** — answers go to the server as well as `localStorage`,
   and the server's copy is written in by a *synchronous* XHR before any
   bundle script runs. Deliberately not a fetch: the dc runtime boots
   itself, so racing it passes on a fast connection and fails on a shop's.
2. **Identity** — the design validated `CD-XXXX-0000`, a format we have
   never issued. It now takes the real `CD-XXXXXX`, and the code from the
   link arrives already filled in and "Recognised".
3. **Never the demo desk** — the bundle defaults to `prefillDemo:true`.
   Served live, the flow starts empty. (Both call sites: initial state *and*
   "start over".)
4. **Verification** — email instead of SMS, worded from the live channel.
5. **The ending** — the code is checked and the desk is created.
6. **The `componentDidUpdate` defect** — the runtime forwards only
   `prevProps`. The old guard substituted `this.state`, which stopped the
   throw but made "the screen changed" permanently false, so `focusStage`
   never ran. The build now keeps its own note of the screen.

## Verification: email now, phone later

The design confirms a mobile by text. There is no SMS provider, so the code
goes to the owner's **email** — the address the invite already reached and
the thing they sign in with.

One constant is the whole switch:

```
VERIFY_CHANNEL = "email" | "phone"     (server/src/routes/onboarding-public.ts)
```

The server sends over it, `GET /state` reports it, and the page words itself
from it — question, help text, "No email yet?" vs "No text yet?", "Wrong
address?" vs "Wrong number?". Setting `VERIFY_CHANNEL=phone` on a box with
Twilio credentials moves the whole flow back to SMS without a screen
changing or a rebuild. `sendSms`/`normalizePhone` are already wired on that
branch. The mobile number is collected and stored either way.

## The API

Public, no session — the code is the key, same trust model as any emailed
link. Only an **invited** or **accepted** application opens. Rate limiting
counts *misses* per IP, never saves.

- `GET  /api/onboarding/:ref/state` → `{ at, data, application, verify }`,
  blanks seeded from the application (only blanks)
- `PUT  /api/onboarding/:ref/state` → the whole blob, debounced by the page
- `POST /api/onboarding/:ref/verify/send` → issues and sends a 6-digit code
- `POST /api/onboarding/:ref/verify/check` → 5 attempts, 10-minute expiry
- `POST /api/onboarding/:ref/launch` → creates the desk, signs them in

**Three things are never stored**: the card (`cardNum`, `cardCvc`,
`cardExp`, `card2*`, `backup`), the password (`ownerPass`), and anything
under a `__` key — or a browser could mark itself confirmed.

Because the password is never stored, **it does not survive a device
change**. Somebody who sets it on the shop laptop and finishes on their
phone is sent back to the account screen with the reason, rather than
failing under a button on the last screen. Verified by resuming a
half-finished setup in a second browser.

## Creating the desk

`server/src/onboarding/provision.ts` — one function, two doors
(`/api/signup/verify` and `/api/onboarding/:ref/launch`), so they cannot
build different things.

- The desk address is never asked for. It comes from the workspace they
  picked on their application, falling back to the shop name, and
  `freeSlug` finds a free one rather than refusing at screen 15.
- The team they listed gets real staff accounts, with the design's role
  names mapped to the ones authorization is written against (Manager →
  `branch_manager`, Cashier → `teller`…). They arrive needing a password
  set — we have no business inventing one. Somebody named without an email
  is recorded but given no account: a login nobody can reach looks like it
  works.
- Everything the design collected lands on `tenants.setup` in the design's
  own words — compliance officer, spreads, opening float, publish mode,
  addons, term, billing address, ID threshold.
- Plans: the design sells `rates`/`full`/`ai`; the server gates on
  `basic`/`pro`/`premium`. `rates`→`basic`, and both `full` and `ai`→
  `premium` with `setup.aiBundle` recording the difference. **Assumption:**
  "Full System — the complete exchange desk" should not be under-entitled,
  and the AI bundle is a product flag rather than a fourth access level.

## The walkthrough

`CD-WALKTHRU` — a permanent application seeded on every boot. It now runs
the *whole* flow including the ending: a real code is issued and must be
typed (it goes to the log instead of an inbox), `/launch` runs, and the one
thing it does not do is create a desk. Verified: after a full browser run
its `tenantId` is still null and its status still `invited`.

## Known and deliberate

- A bare `/onboarding` with no code works on `localStorage` alone and never
  syncs. Without a code the server cannot know whose setup it is.
- Synchronous XHR blocks first paint by roughly the round-trip.
- Once the desk exists, `PUT /state` answers 409. The page keeps autosaving
  for a moment afterwards; the server refusing to overwrite a finished
  onboarding is the correct end of that conversation.
